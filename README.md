# MNIST-FASHION-IMAGE-CLASSIFICATION

The Fashion-MNIST clothing classification problem is a new standard dataset used in computer vision and deep learning.
It is a dataset comprised of 60,000 small square 28Ã—28 pixel grayscale images of items of 10 types of clothing, such as shoes, t-shirts, dresses, and more.
The mapping of all 0-9 integers to class labels is listed below.
0: T-shirt/top
1: Trouser
2: Pullover
3: Dress
4: Coat
5: Sandal
6: Shirt
7: Sneaker
8: Bag
9: Ankle boot
Fashion-MNIST was proposed to be a replacement for MNIST, and although it has not been solved, it is possible to routinely achieve error rates of 10% or less. 
Like MNIST, it can be a useful starting point for developing and practicing a methodology for solving image classification using convolutional neural networks
